紹介\\n小学3年生の時、何度でも作り直せるプログラミングの世界に出会い、開発言語をBASIC、アセンブラ、C言語と変えながらソフト作りに熱中する。福井高専に在学中、研究会やアルバイトでソフト開発に携わり、自分が開発したものを人に使ってもらう喜びを知る。卒業後、フリープログラマーをしながら起業を考える。2つの会社の創業を経て、現在の株式会社jig.jpを設立。当時モバイルサイトしか見られなかった携帯電話向けに、パソコン用サイトを閲覧可能とする世界初のダウンロード型のフルブラウザ『jigブラウザ』を開発。より豊かな社会のモデルを探るため、本店があり、在住している福井県鯖江市で、こどもやシニア向けのプログラミング講座、自治体オープンデータ「データシティ鯖江」とそれを活用する団体「Code for Sabae」、首都圏の起業家と交流するITイベントなどを手がけている。また、高専生の更なる活躍に期待しており、全国の高専からのインターン受け入れや講演会、「Code for KOSEN」などを通じて、後輩のバックアップに取り組んでいる。\\n\",\n\t\t\t\t\"image\": \"/img/2017_fukuno@2x.jpg\",\n\t\t\t\t\"github\":

ICT：Information and Communication Technology(インフォメーション・アンド・コミュニケーション・テクノロジー)やIoT：Internet of Things（モノのインターネット）といったキーワードも至る所で見聞きするようになってきました。\n                </p>\n                <p>\n\n                    ITサービスやスマートフォンアプリを利用するコトが当たり前になりつつある今〜将来「エンジニアに求められるコト」はどんな事でしょう。\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    スマートシティやシビックテック、オープンデータといった「より生活に近いところ」でのエンジニアリングも日本国内で広まりつつあります。\n                    エンジニアスキルを活用して「みんなに使ってもらえるサービス」「みんなの課題解決に繋がるサービス」「社会に役立つサービス」ってどのようなモノが有るんでしょうか。\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    エンジニアが自身のスキルを活かすコトで、より素敵なエンジニアリングライフを送るためには。\n                    そういった事について様々な観点で登壇者の話を聞く中で考えを巡らしたり、気づきを他の人と共有したり、自身の現場に持ち帰ってチャレンジしてみてください。\n                </p>\n

紹介\\n小学3年生の時、何度でも作り直せるプログラミングの世界に出会い、開発言語をBASIC、アセンブラ、C言語と変えながらソフト作りに熱中する。福井高専に在学中、研究会やアルバイトでソフト開発に携わり、自分が開発したものを人に使ってもらう喜びを知る。卒業後、フリープログラマーをしながら起業を考える。2つの会社の創業を経て、現在の株式会社jig.jpを設立。当時モバイルサイトしか見られなかった携帯電話向けに、パソコン用サイトを閲覧可能とする世界初のダウンロード型のフルブラウザ『jigブラウザ』を開発。より豊かな社会のモデルを探るため、本店があり、在住している福井県鯖江市で、こどもやシニア向けのプログラミング講座、自治体オープンデータ「データシティ鯖江」とそれを活用する団体「Code for Sabae」、首都圏の起業家と交流するITイベントなどを手がけている。また、高専生の更なる活躍に期待しており、全国の高専からのインターン受け入れや講演会、「Code for KOSEN」などを通じて、後輩のバックアップに取り組んでいる。\\n\",\n\t\t\t\"image\": \"/img/2017_fukuno@2x.jpg\",\n\t\t\t\"github\":
