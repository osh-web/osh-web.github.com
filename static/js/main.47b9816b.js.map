Whoever\n\t * instantiates a transaction can provide enforcers of the invariants at\n\t * creation time. The `Transaction` class itself will supply one additional\n\t * automatic invariant for you - the invariant that any transaction instance\n\t * should not be run while it is already being run. You would typically create a\n\t * single instance of a `Transaction` for reuse multiple times, that potentially\n\t * is used to wrap several different methods. Wrappers are extremely simple -\n\t * they only require implementing two methods.\n\t *\n\t * <pre>\n\t *                       wrappers (injected at creation time)\n\t *                                      +        +\n\t *                                      |        |\n\t *                    +-----------------|--------|--------------+\n\t *                    |                 v        |              |\n\t *                    |      +---------------+   |              |\n\t *                    |   +--|    wrapper1   |---|----+         |\n\t *                    |   |  +---------------+   v    |         |\n\t *                    |   |          +-------------+  |         |\n\t *                    |   |     +----|   wrapper2  |--------+   |\n\t *                    |   |     |    +-------------+  |     |   |\n\t *                    |   |     |                     |     |   |\n\t *                    |   v     v                     v     v   | wrapper\n\t *                    | +---+ +---+   +---------+   +---+ +---+ | invariants\n\t * perform(anyMethod) | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | | maintained\n\t * +----------------->|-|---|-|---|-->|anyMethod|---|---|-|---|-|-------->\n\t *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\n\t *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\n\t *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\n\t *                    | +---+ +---+   +---------+   +---+ +---+ |\n\t *                    |  initialize                    close    |\n\t *                    +-----------------------------------------+\n\t * </pre>\n\t *\n\t * Use cases:\n\t * - Preserving the input selection ranges before/after reconciliation.\n\t *   Restoring selection even in the event of an unexpected error.\n\t * - Deactivating events while rearranging the DOM, preventing blurs/focuses,\n\t *   while guaranteeing that afterwards, the event system is reactivated.\n\t * - Flushing a queue of collected DOM mutations to the main UI thread after a\n\t *   reconciliation takes place in a worker thread.\n\t * - Invoking any collected `componentDidUpdate` callbacks after rendering new\n\t *   content.\n\t * - (Future use case): Wrapping particular flushes of the `ReactWorker` queue\n\t *   to preserve the `scrollTop` (an automatic scroll aware DOM).\n\t * - (Future use case): Layout calculations before and after DOM updates.\n\t *\n\t * Transactional plugin API:\n\t * - A module that has an `initialize` method that returns any precomputation.\n\t * - and a `close` method that accepts the precomputation. `close` is invoked\n\t *   when the wrapped process is completed, or has failed.\n\t *\n\t * @param {Array<TransactionalWrapper>} transactionWrapper Wrapper modules\n\t * that implement `initialize` and `close`.\n\t * @return {Transaction} Single transaction for reuse in thread.\n\t *\n\t * @class Transaction\n\t */\n\tvar TransactionImpl = {\n\t  /**\n\t   * Sets up this instance so that it is prepared for collecting metrics.

略歴\\n1978年11月8日石川県生まれ。国立福井工業高等専門学校電子情報工学科を卒業後、2000年に有限会社シャフトを設立しCTOに就任。2001年に有限会社ユーエヌアイ研究所を設立、代表取締役社長に就任。2003年5月に株式会社jig.jpを設立し代表取締役社長に就任（現任）。\\n2016年に内閣官房情報通信技術（IT）総合戦略室が任命する「オープンデータ伝道師（8名）」のひとり\\n\\n# 紹介\\n小学3年生の時、何度でも作り直せるプログラミングの世界に出会い、開発言語をBASIC、アセンブラ、C言語と変えながらソフト作りに熱中する。福井高専に在学中、研究会やアルバイトでソフト開発に携わり、自分が開発したものを人に使ってもらう喜びを知る。卒業後、フリープログラマーをしながら起業を考える。2つの会社の創業を経て、現在の株式会社jig.jpを設立。当時モバイルサイトしか見られなかった携帯電話向けに、パソコン用サイトを閲覧可能とする世界初のダウンロード型のフルブラウザ『jigブラウザ』を開発。より豊かな社会のモデルを探るため、本店があり、在住している福井県鯖江市で、こどもやシニア向けのプログラミング講座、自治体オープンデータ「データシティ鯖江」とそれを活用する団体「Code for Sabae」、首都圏の起業家と交流するITイベントなどを手がけている。また、高専生の更なる活躍に期待しており、全国の高専からのインターン受け入れや講演会、「Code for KOSEN」などを通じて、後輩のバックアップに取り組んでいる。\\n\",\n\t\t\t\t\"image\": \"/img/2017_fukuno@2x.jpg\",\n\t\t\t\t\"github\":

紹介\\n小学3年生の時、何度でも作り直せるプログラミングの世界に出会い、開発言語をBASIC、アセンブラ、C言語と変えながらソフト作りに熱中する。福井高専に在学中、研究会やアルバイトでソフト開発に携わり、自分が開発したものを人に使ってもらう喜びを知る。卒業後、フリープログラマーをしながら起業を考える。2つの会社の創業を経て、現在の株式会社jig.jpを設立。当時モバイルサイトしか見られなかった携帯電話向けに、パソコン用サイトを閲覧可能とする世界初のダウンロード型のフルブラウザ『jigブラウザ』を開発。より豊かな社会のモデルを探るため、本店があり、在住している福井県鯖江市で、こどもやシニア向けのプログラミング講座、自治体オープンデータ「データシティ鯖江」とそれを活用する団体「Code for Sabae」、首都圏の起業家と交流するITイベントなどを手がけている。また、高専生の更なる活躍に期待しており、全国の高専からのインターン受け入れや講演会、「Code for KOSEN」などを通じて、後輩のバックアップに取り組んでいる。\\n\",\n\t\t\t\"image\": \"/img/2017_fukuno@2x.jpg\",\n\t\t\t\"github\":
